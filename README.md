Looked at what is availalbe in the watch window. Changed some variables during a run
Reviewed the call stack window
Difference between a crash running with/without the debugger
Looked at the Debuger Log
Talked about how to set up the IDE to step into Qt source
Stepped into QML javascript

Also some general application design such as View Management, localization, and Reloading QML from disk.
