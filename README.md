# DebugDemo
Code from OC Qt Meetup 6/14/2017

We used this test application to demo and discuss:
 - Different types of breakpoints (line number, condition, exceptions, etc.)
 - Using the watch window
 - Modifying variables during a run
 - The call stack window
 - Difference between crashing with/without the debugger
 - The Debugger Log
 - Stepping through JavaScript code

We also talked about how to set up the IDE to step into Qt source as well as some general application design topics such as View Management, Localization, and Reloading QML from files on disk.
